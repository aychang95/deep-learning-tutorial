### Introduction
This repository is an in-depth tutorial library on various foundational and advanced deep learning techniques.  The focus of these tutorials will focus on very low-level implementations of topics ranging from simple multi-layer networks to transformer network architectures that soley rely on attention mechanisms. This tutorial will also act as a guide for Numpy and Pytorch use in deep learning.  More details can be found in each tutorial topic.
